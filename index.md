## Hello, I'm John 

#### ...this is my blog

I live in [Minneapolis](http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/) and work for [Target](https://www.codewithtarget.com/). I have a history in C# and .NET development but am focusing more into the Open Source world in recent months. 

I am especially passionate about agility within the software development process and the toolkits that developers use to accomplish their work.
